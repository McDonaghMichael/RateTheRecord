# RateTheRecord
*RateTheRecord* is a project submission for my Data Representation and Querying Project.The Project was created using the MERN Method using MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS.

RateTheRecord allows for users to rate any of the albums on the site giving a comment review and a rating between 1 - 10. The rating they give the album will affect its chart position on the [Leaderboard](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Leaderboard) page. The [Leaderboard](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Leaderboard) ranks each of the albums based on their average ratings.

[Artists](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Artists) and [Albums](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Albums) can be found in their respective pages that will basically showcase all of the [Artists](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Artists) and [Albums](https://github.com/McDonaghMichael/RateTheRecord/wiki/Albums) in grid format. When clicking on an album or artist you can see detailed information regarding them.

I've implemented an Admin panel that allows the creation, editing and deletion of artists & albums, along with the ability to review comment reviews that have been reported by users.
